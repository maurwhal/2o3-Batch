# Privacy

Short version: **Files you open are processed locally in your browser.** The app does not upload, save, or send data anywhere.

- No servers, accounts, or databases.
- No cookies or analytics.
- Closing the tab clears the session (unless your browser restores tabs).
- If you fork/host elsewhere, verify your platform serves static files only (GitHub Pages does).
